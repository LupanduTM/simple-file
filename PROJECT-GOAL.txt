i what to build system that uses qr codes to handle payments using mobile money. the tech stack involves spring boot for microservice architecture and react native and nextjs for the frontend. before we proceed let me give you some context. in zambia public transport is operated on a cash transaction system. as a customer when i board the bus the conductor asks me where i'm heading based on the bus stations on route to the buses final destination(e.g say the bus is going from point A to D. point A being the primary bus station and D being the end bus stop. between these points A and D are bus stops B and C. each bus stop has a certain price from A. A bus ride from A to B is K15, A-C=K20, A-D=K25.) Then i give the conductor the cash and tell him where i'm going. based on the fee he gives me my change. Now to avoid the problems which come with cash transactions. i'm propolsing gocashless system. now when i enter the bus and the conductor the asks me where i am going. now that we bothÂ  have the apps, On his app he just selects the bus stop "e.g bus stop B" and based on what he registered about the bus stop information on his app a qr code is generated and displayed on the phone screen. then i the customer/passenger open my phone app and scan the qr code onthe conductors app. i then receive a notification from MTN momo mobile money mobile money to enter my pin and confirm payment. when i make the payment the conductor receives a notification the the payment has been made. we can both check the transaction history on each individual app. Then for the bus company, they can register on our web application. once they have logged in they can view the transactions only from they're conductors apps on a dashboard. Gocashless has access to all users information i.e passengers, conductors, and bus company.
